This is a work in progress:

Here's a [http://www.tenacioussoftware.com/crn_stats/dec29/crn_stats_dec_29.htm spreadsheet] comparing the RGB [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMSE RMSE] (root mean square error) of RYG's real-time DXT1 compressor, crnlib's DXT1 compressor using uniform or perceptual metrics (which is very similar to ATI_Compress or squish), verses .CRN at .75-2.0bpp at .25bpp increments. This spreadsheet also has two columns showing how many bits/pixel are needed by LZMA to compress DXT1 uniform and perceptual .DDS files.

Here's the [http://www.tenacioussoftware.com/crn_stats/dec29/crn_stats_dec_29.xlsx raw Excel spreadsheet file]. 

This was generated by running crunch_x64.exe a bunch of times with the -csvfile command line option. Note that each .CRN column was generated by specifying the -bitrate option, which really only limits the *maximum* bitrate a file is allowed to use. .CRN is a variable block size format, and the front end limits the maximum endpoint/selector palette sizes to 8192 entries each. So for a few of the simpler images here very high bitrates (like 1.75 or 2.0bpp) may not actually be achievable.

These RMSE values should be comparable to the values in Charles Bloom's very useful [http://cbloomrants.blogspot.com/2008/11/11-20-08-dxtc-part-3.html blog post] comparing various DXT1 compressors. (My RYG RMSE stats are very slightly different from the ones here, and I don't know exactly why, but I'm guessing our versions are slightly different.)
