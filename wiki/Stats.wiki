#summary Statistics

This is a work in progress:

Here's a spreadsheet comparing the RGB [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMSE RMSE] (root mean square error) of RYG's real-time DXT1 compressor, crnlib's DXT1 compressor using uniform or perceptual metrics, vs. .CRN at .75-2.0bpp at .25bpp increments. This spreadsheet also has two columns showing how many bits/pixel are needed by LZMA to compress DXT1 uniform and perceptual .DDS files.
