 * crnlib currently assumes you'll be further losslessly compressing its output .DDS files using LZMA. However, some engines use weaker codecs such as LZO, zlib, etc., so crnlib's bitrate measurements will be inaccurate. It should be easy to allow the caller to plug-in custom lossless compressors for bitrate measurement.

 * Compressing to a desired bitrate can be very time consuming, especially when processing large (2k or 4k) images to the .CRN format. There are several high-level optimizations employed when compressing to clustered DXTn .DDS files using multiple trials, but not so for .CRN.

 The current approach compresses the input image multiple times, using an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation_search interpolation search] to find the integer quality that gets closest to the target bitrate.

 * The .CRN compressor does not currently use 3 color (transparent) DXT1 blocks at all, only 4 color blocks. So it doesn't support DXT1A transparency, and its output quality suffers a little due to this limitation. (Note that the clustered DXTn compressor used when writing clustered .DDS files does *not* have this limitation.)

 * DXT3 is not supported when writing .CRN or clustered DXTn DDS files. (DXT3 is supported by crnlib's when compressing to regular DXTn DDS files.) You'll get DXT5 files if you request DXT3. However, DXT3 is supported by the regular DXTn block compressor. (DXT3's 4bpp fixed alpha sucks verses DXT5 alpha blocks, so I don't see this as a big deal.)

 * The DXT5_CCXY format uses a simple YCoCg encoding that seems workable but hasn't been tuned for max. quality yet.

 * Ignore the SSIM statistics printed when using the -imagestats option - it's currently bogus. I implemented this before fully understanding how the metric is computed over the entire image.
